"""
This is a sample Python program with some things to fix in it.
It's your first program in Computer Science! Read through the file
looking for the comment lines -- ones that start with a hash tag (#)
-- and try to do what they ask. Don't worry if you mess up the file:
it's only for practice!

CTRL-x means hold the control key while also pressing the x key.

  # First: go to line 125 by pressing CTRL-g and entering 125.  You'll
  # find a message there, which you can copy with CTRL-c and paste on
  # line 17 with CTRL-v.
  print("Welcome to CS21!")
  print("The secret message is:CS is Fun")


  # The line below is a mess. Delete it by highlighting the line
  # with your mouse and pressing the backspace key.
  

  # The two "print" lines below need to be indented. Highlight these
  # two lines by dragging the mouse across BOTH of the lines, then
  # press Tab to indent them.

  # CTRL-z (undo) or CTRL-SHIFT-z (redo).
  


  # There should currently be a small dot next to the name
  # 'practice.py' in the file tabs along the top of the vscode window
  # -- that means you have unsaved changes.  To save a file, press
  # CTRL-s and the dot should disappear.


  # These next lines are OK, but for now, we want to comment them all
  # out.  You could put a # sign at the beginning of each line, but if
  # you want to comment multiple lines at once, highlight all of the
  # lines and press CTRL-/ (control + forward slash). You can also 
  # uncomment them by repeating these steps (highlighting, CTRL-/).
  # print("this line is OK")
  # print("but comment me out")
  # print("for now...")



  # To cut a line, highlight it and press CTRL-x.  To paste what you
  # cut, press CTRL-v. Cut this line, then go line 152 (CTRL-g) and
  # paste it there with CTRL-v. Come back to line 57 when you're done.
  


  # Where is CompSci? Use CTRL-f to search the document and find where
  # it appears. You can press ENTER to move to the next instance or
  # SHIFT-ENTER to search backwards to the previous instance.

  # Edit the next print statement to show how many times you found
  # CompSci in this document.

  # Finally, use CTRL-s to save your changes.  After you save and quit, try
  # running the file with this command in the terminal:
  # python3 practice.py

# Super.  The secret message is:  CS is Fun
# Now go back to line 17 (CTRL-g)
























# Paste the end line here:
print("This is the end.")
# Then, jump back to line 57
