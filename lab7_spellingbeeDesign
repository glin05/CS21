"""
Create your top-down design for the spelling game here.

Your top-down design should meet the following requirements:
- main should be completely written
- main should call the functions that you create in your design
- all functions must be stubbed out with purpose, parameters, and return
- your program should run without syntax errors

Once your design is complete, send an email to tdd@cs.swarthmore.edu and
be sure to copy both partners on the email.
